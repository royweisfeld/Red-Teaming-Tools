# Bopscrk
Bopscrk (**Before Outset PaSsword CRacKing**) is a tool to **assist** in all the **previous process of password cracking**. By now, it's able to generate smart and powerful wordlists.
  
  
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/R3nt0n/bopscrk/blob/master/img/example.gif" /></p>
  

The first idea was inspired by **Cupp** and **Crunch**. We could say that bopscrk is a wordlist generator **situated between them**, taking the best of each one. The challenge was try to apply the Cupp's idea to more generic-situations and amplify the shoot-range of the resultant wordlist, without loosing this custom-wordlist-profiler feature.


## Changelist

**EXCLUDE WORDLISTS**: Speed improvement using multithreaded exclusions.  
**NEW FEATURE**: Lyrics searching related to artists to increase the wordlist chances.


## How it works
+ You have to **provide** some **words** which will act as a **base**.
+ The tool will generate **all possible combinations** between them.
+ To generate more combinations, it will add some **common separators** (e.g. "-", "_", "."), **random numbers** and **special chars**.
+ You can enable **leet** and **case transforms** to increase your chances.
+ If you enable **lyricpass mode**, the tool will ask you about **artists** and it will download all his **songs' lyrics**. Each line will be added as a new word. Then it will be **transform in several ways** (leet, case, only first letters, with and without spaces...). Artist names will be added too.
+ You can provide wordlists that you already tried against the target in order to exclude all this words from the resultant wordlist (`-x`). 
 

## Requirements
+ Python 2.7
+ requests (*optional*, only if you want to use lyricpass)
+ beautifulsoup4 (*optional*, only if you want to use lyricpass)

## Usage
```

  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -i, --interactive  interactive mode, the script will ask you about target
  -w                 words to combine comma-separated (non-interactive mode)
  --min              min length for the words to generate (default: 4)
  --max              max length for the words to generate (default: 32)
  -c, --case         enable case transformations
  -l, --leet         enable leet transformations
  -n                 max amount of words to combine each time (default: 2)
  -a , --artists     artists to search song lyrics (comma-separated)
  -A, --lyrics-all   enable all possible transforms with lyrics
  -x , --exclude     exclude all the words included in other wordlists
                     (several wordlists should be comma-separated)
  -o , --output      output file to save the wordlist (default: tmp.txt)


```
 

## Tips
+ Fields can be left **empty**.
+ Words have to be written **without accents**, just normal characters.
+ In the others field you can write **several words comma-separated**. *Example*: 2C,Flipper.
+ Using the **non-interactive mode**, you should provide years in the long and short way (1970,70) to get the same result than the interactive mode.
+ You have to be careful with **-n** argument. If you set a big value, it could result in **too huge wordlists**. I recommend values between 2 and 5.
+ To feed lyricpass with **several artists** through command line you should provides it **comma-separated** and **quotes-enclosed**. *Example*: `-a "john doe,john smith"`

### Lyricpass 
This feature is based in a modified version of a [tool](https://github.com/initstring/lyricpass) developed originally by [initstring](https://github.com/initstring/).

It will retrieve all lyrics from all songs which belongs to artists that you provide. As this feature can make the wordlist grow too much, **by default it will store each phrase reduced to its initials** (which will be transformed later if you have activated leet and case transforms). As one of the main methods to use lyrics as a password is to take just initials, It should be usually enough.

With `--lyrics-all`, it will store the raw phrases too and apply some transforms over them (like convert spaces into dots and other special chars). This method is **strongly unrecommended**, because 5000 phrases could become 5.000.000 easily.

If you want to make an extensive and accurate lyrics-wordlist related to a target, better choice is to use it without any other words added (and maybe without leet and case transforms). 


## TO-DO list
+ **Lyricpass** still needs some tweaks to speed up the search process (I would appreciate any help).
